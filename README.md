# Hello and Welcome



# Inspiration

The concept of our project is to create a social media type platform for greeting cards.
Our plan? Create a modular platform that allows users to create any kind of card, for any one,
for any reason and for as much cusomization as you need. While compiling research on what makes
a great social media platform we came across Twitter. Twitter is Structured with small cards that
are short, sweet, and to the point. Our aim was to structure our site to simulate the same interactive
aura of Twitter and attempt to create an interactive enviroment for creativity to flow and emotions to flow 
in each individual card!!



# Work Flow and seamless intigration

The most important factor to any project that involves multiple individual is Co-op flawless communication.
Creating a basic strucure with designated times for meetings proved critical to the progress of this project.
These times accomplished two primary goals, to catch up the rest of the group on progress made and future plans,
as well as to recive imput on possible issues and requests for addtions to the code. Having clear cut goals 
that are pre defined made it super easy to reach the goal at the end of the day and to steadily have progress.
